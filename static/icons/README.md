# FAVICONS
Favicons have to be generated for each and every client. Provisions have already
been made to make sure the assets are served in the head file but you will have
to replace the assets.

Doing so is quite simple:

1. Go to (Real Favicon Generator)[https://realfavicongenerator.net/] and upload
   your 500x500 transparent PNG image supplied by the design team
2. Collect the generated zip file and replace the images inside of
   '/static/icons'
3. Test your work by running the build then the server
